# Javascript-Node (backend) / Typescript-React (frontend) demonstration app

## Introduction

I created this Javascript-Node (backend) / Typescript-React (frontend) demonstration application for my learning purposes. I'm about to start a new project at the beginning of 2023 using these technologies, and I wanted to learn to use these tools and technologies in practice before I start working on the project. I have used React with [Clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org/) / [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/), and therefore it is interesting to compare my Clojurescript experience to Typescript / React when implementing this demonstration application.

## Technologies

Here is a short description of the technologies used in this demonstration application:

- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): A lightweight, interpreted language that runs in the browser, and on the backend using Node.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/): A Javascript runtime for the backend.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A strongly typed programming language for Javascript.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces for the browser.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): A popular state management library for Javascript Applications.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A tool for frontend development (e.g. hot reloading for the browser).
