# Javascript-Node (backend) / Typescript-React (frontend) demonstration app

## Introduction

I created this Javascript-Node (backend) / Typescript-React (frontend) demonstration application for my learning purposes. I'm about to start a new project at the beginning of 2023 using these technologies, and I wanted to learn to use these tools and technologies in practice before I start working on the project. I have used React with [Clojurescript](https://clojurescript.org/) / [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io/), and therefore it is interesting to compare my Clojurescript experience to Typescript / React when implementing this demonstration application.

In this repository, I have implemented the same webstore demo application that I previously implemented as a Clojure full-stack app, described in my blog post: [Clojure Re-Frame Exercise](https://www.karimarttila.fi/clojure/2020/10/15/clojure-re-frame-exercise.html), but this time using Javascript and Typescript.

Special thanks to [Thomas De Bluts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-de-bluts-296a74131/) for all the help while learning these technologies!

## Technologies

Here is a short description of the technologies used in this demonstration application:

- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a lightweight interpreted language that runs in the browser, and on the backend using Node.
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a Javascript runtime for the backend.
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a strongly typed programming language for Javascript.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces for the browser.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is a popular state management library for Javascript Applications.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a tool for frontend development (e.g. hot reloading for the browser).
